#### Step 1: Get an ad-blocker

I highly recommend you guys use an ad-blocker like [**uBlock Origin**](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) as must have extension. It will block annoying, p\*rn ads when downloading mods on ModsFire or ShareMods or anysite like that and make it easier for you of course 

#### Step 2: Using a Download Manager

Of course, Internet Download Manager is needed cause most cars and tracks more are over hundred MBs of size. IDM will speed up download process and reduce the chance of corrupted ZIP archive like browser download.

Check: [**Internet Download Manager**](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) / [**IDM Integration Module - Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/idm-integration-module/ngpampappnmepgilojfohadhhmbhlaek)

#### Step 3: Download mods on mb64

Search and choose mods you want to download, scroll down and click on the "ModsFire" (Mediafire or other hosts sometime) logo in the box.

It will bring you to download page, *ModsFire* or *ShareMods* depends on file size. Click the <span style="color:blue">**GENERATE LINK**</span> button, wait a bit for **DOWNLOAD** button to show up. Now click that *big* **DOWNLOAD** button to get your mod!
