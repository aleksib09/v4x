An extension for Assetto Corsa which started as an attempt to add some sort dynamic lighting, hence the name. Still in development, as usual.

*Weâ€™d like to thank the Kunos developers for all of the effort they put into making AC such a great simulator and giving us an excellent basis for our work.*

**Some of features:**
  - Various physics extensions by mclarenf1papa
  - Optimizations and fixes
  - Dynamic lights as part of Lighting FX
  - Weather FX: fully scriptable dynamic weather engine
  - Extra FX: local reflections, bounced lighting, temporal anti-aliasing, etc.
  - Particles FX: sparks, new smoke, bits of grass and dirt and more
  - Car extensions: reverse lights, turning signals, working odometers and more
  - And more (still compiling the full list)
