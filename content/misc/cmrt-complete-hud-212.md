New version 2.1.2 of CMRT Complete HUD is now available.

This update brings to the interface a new sound when the DRS is gained and DRS zones visualization into the Map. We have also added an option to extend the Radar range and we have improved the RPM Lights at Power Peak settings in the Gearbox.

#### Map
In this update it is now possible to visualize the DRS zones on the Map. They will be displayed in green on the track. You can enable this setting under the Map tab inside the Settings app.

#### Gearbox
The setting RPM Lights at Power Peak will now apply globally to every car.

Users that previously have enabled this setting will have to reenable it again. This will need to be performed only once.
