The McLaren MP4-22 was a Formula One car designed by McLaren for the 2007 Formula One season. It was driven by the defending two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso, who departed from Renault to join McLaren, and debutant Lewis Hamilton. The car proved to be very competitive and reliable, winning eight out of 17 races and only having 2 DNFs, but however, due to a fierce rivalry between the two drivers, combined with the spying scandal between Ferrari and McLaren which led the team disqualified, resulted in the team losing both World Championship Titles to Ferrari.
