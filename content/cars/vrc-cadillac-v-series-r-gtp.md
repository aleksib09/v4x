The Cadillac V-Series.R is General Motorsâ€™ latest top-level prototype entry for global sports car competition. Built to the universal Le Mans Daytona h regulations that made their debut for the 2023 season, the V-Series.R was launched in both the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with entries from Chip Ganassi Racing and Action Express Racing, and internationally with another Ganassi-run team.
