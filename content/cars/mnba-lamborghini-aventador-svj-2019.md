Unveiled at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the Aventador SVJ (Super Veloce Jota) is a powerful and track focused iteration of the Aventador SV. The 6.5-litre L539 V12 engine used in the entire Aventador lineage has been reworked and now generates a maximum power output of 770 PS (566 kW; 759 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 720 N⋅m (531 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm. The weight saving measures such as the extensive use of carbon fibre and titanium in the exhaust system has brought the weight down to 1,525 kg (3,362 lb), giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 1.98 kg/hp. The Aventador SVJ can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.6 seconds and can attain a top speed of over 349 km/h (217 mph).

A prototype of the variant had previously made a new production car lap around the Nurburgring Nordschleife in July 2018, beating the previous record holder, the Porsche 911 GT2 RS by setting a lap time of 6:44.97 with Lamborghini test driver Marco Mapelli behind the wheel achieved by using the Pirelli Trofeo R tyres available with the car as an option.

The Aventador SVJ is the first production V12 Lamborghini model to feature Lamborghini's Aerodynamica Lamborghini Attiva (ALA) system. This allows the car to achieve 40% more downforce than the Aventador SV and 1% reduction in the coefficient of drag. The system adds aerodynamic components to the car including a disconnected front splitter, tri-dimensional air outlet on the bonnet, a large carbon fibre rear wing with a central fin, underbody aero design with vortex generators, and a large rear diffuser. The system works in conjunction with Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Attiva 2.0 (LDVA 2.0) management system, which uses inertial sensors to control the car's aero in 500 milliseconds.
