The new 992-generation GT3 is powered by the same four-litre flat-six engine the Motorsport department fits to its GT3 Cup race car, power and torque are increased by a marginal 10bhp and 7lb over the previous generation car to 503bhp and 347lb ft respectfully. It remains rear-wheel drive, naturally, and is offered with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed PDK transmission. 

Built on the same production line as the race motor, the new GT3’s dry-sumped four-litre (102mm bore x 81.5mm stroke, 13:3:1 compression ratio and an 9,000rpm redline) features the same six-barrel throttle bodies and intake as the racer, as well as a new stainless steel exhaust system that’s 10 kilos lighter than the 991.2 GT3’s.
