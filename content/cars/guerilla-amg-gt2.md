The Mercedes-AMG GT2 is the most powerful homologated race car in history of our Customer Racing programme. Both power and 
top speed of the new race car rank above GT3 level. The Mercedes-AMG GT2 was developed to the technical GT2 regulations of 
the Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) and particularly aims at ambitious amateur drivers. As a result, the new model bridges the gap 
between the Mercedes-AMG GT3 and the Mercedes-AMG GT4. Thanks to its intuitive operation, the usual high safety standard 
and an outstanding drivability, the Mercedes-AMG GT2 provides a convincing overall package for the increasing 
number of attractive international GT2 race events.
