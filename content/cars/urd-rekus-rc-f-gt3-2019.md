In 2014, Lexus unveiled the RC F GT3 concept, a racing version of the RC F developed by Lexus and in-house motorsport tuning subsidiary Technocraft for participation the Group GT3 category. It was unveiled at the 2014 Geneva International Motor Show. The Lexus was officially homologated for the Group 3 class in 2017, after a few models had competed in the Super GT GT300 class and the SP-X class of VLN. The car competed for several years in the Blancpain GT Series with Emil Frey Racing. Competition with the car in Europe ended after Lexus withdrew their European customer support in 2020. The car has also competed in the IMSA SportsCar Championship since 2017, taking the GTD Pro manufacturers title in 2023, and competes in the 2024 FIA World Endurance Championship in the LMGT3 class with Akkodis ASP. It is set to be replaced by a new Lexus-badged GT3 car based on the Toyota GR GT3 concept.
