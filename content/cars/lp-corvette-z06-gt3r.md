Upon the global sunsetting of the GTE spec at the end of the 2023 racing season, Chevrolet's Corvette C8.R would require a successor to be built under GT3 specifications. Enter the Z06 GT3.R, which would also see the brand pivot from a direct factory-backed Corvette Racing program to numerous customer teams-although the same Pratt Miller Motorsports group that led the factory GTE effort remains a key part of the racing efforts.

The Z06 GT3.R shares plenty with the C8.R it replaces, most notably the 5.5-liter LT6-based V8 engine. The car took its first IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship podium in the GTD Pro class at Laguna Seca in spring 2024, with Nicky Catsburg and Tommy Milner teaming up to finish third in class. More wins and podiums are sure to follow as the Z06 GT3.R builds upon the Corvette's extensive history of sports car racing success.
