The seventh-generation Ford Mustang has been the linchpin of Ford's modern motorsport efforts around the world, from the NASCAR Cup Series to Australia's Supercars series. It was no surprise, then, when the Blue Oval revealed that it would return to the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for the first time since 2019 with the Mustang GT3, based on the 2024 Mustang Dark Horse model.

The Ford Mustang GT3 is powered by a 5.4-liter, naturally aspirated Ford Coyote V8 engine. Built and campaigned by Multimatic in the GTD Pro class, and run as a customer car by Proton Competition in both GTD and international GT3 series, the car also marks the first time since 1997 that a Mustang will compete at Le Mans. With past Le Mans winners like Mike Rockenfeller and Joey Hand drafted in to run with Ford's factory IMSA program, expectations are high as the brand writes the next chapter of the Mustang's racing legacy.
