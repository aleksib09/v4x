The Ferrari 296 GT3 represents the future of the Prancing Horse in GT racing, a sector that has always seen the closest relationship with customers and the greatest transfer of technology and innovative solutions to production cars.
The latest evolution of the Maranello company’s two-seater mid-rear-engined sports berlinetta concept that redefines the idea of fun behind the wheel to provide pure excitement in pursuit of top performance or everyday driving. The 296 GT3 incorporates the values of its road-going “twin”, while adding depth. This is due to the commitment and know-how of everyone at Competizioni GT.
