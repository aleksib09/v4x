The SC63 represents a milestone for Lamborghini Squadra Corse. The first Lamborghini hybrid racing car prototype will make its debut at the 2024 FIA World Endurance Championship (Hypercar class) and at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (GTP class). This will take Lamborghini to the highest level of covered-wheel motorsport, with the chance to race in the worldâ€™s most prestigious endurance competitions such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 24 hours of Daytona.
