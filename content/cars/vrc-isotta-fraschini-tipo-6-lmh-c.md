The Isotta Fraschini Tipo 6 LMH Competizione (also known as the Tipo 6 LMH-C) is a sports prototype developed by Isotta Fraschini and Michelotto for the Le Mans Hypercar class of the FIA World Endurance Championship. Other versions were made, including a track day version and a road version, respectively called the Pista and Strada.

Isotta Fraschini first announced that the Tipo 6 LMH Competizione would be created for competition in the Le Mans Hypercar class in the fall of 2022. The car was designed with support from Michelotto, with Williams Advanced Engineering developing the aero package. As the most budget-limited team on the Hypercar grid in 2024, the car was down on pace from the rest of the Hypercar field. The car is powered by a HWA-tuned 3.0 liter 90-degree V6 single turbocharged engine and feature a front axle-mounted electric engine, together producing around 700 horsepower.
