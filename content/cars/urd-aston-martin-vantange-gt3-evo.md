The Aston Martin Vantage GT3 Evo is an evolution of the Vantage GT3 race car, developed through a collaboration between Aston Martin Racing (AMR) and Aston Martin Performance Technologies (AMPT). This partnership has resulted in significant enhancements to the vehicle's aerodynamics, suspension, and overall performance, aiming to provide a more stable and competitive racing experience.

One of the key features of the Vantage GT3 Evo is its improved aerodynamic package, designed to offer better stability under braking and increased downforce. The suspension system has also been revised to enhance handling and adaptability across various racing circuits. These upgrades make the Vantage GT3 Evo a versatile and formidable contender in GT racing events worldwide.

The Vantage GT3 Evo is built upon the success of its predecessor, which debuted in 2018 and secured 52 class wins, including victories at prestigious events like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Daytona, and Spa. The Evo version aims to continue this legacy by offering teams and drivers a competitive edge in upcoming races.
